title: Issue Tracking Integrations
description: Integrate your CodeStream installation with popular issue tracking services
---

CodeStream can be integrated with a number of popular issue tracking services.
Some of them (those below) require configuration by the CodeStream server
administrator. The pages in this section will walk you through setting up each
of the services and adding the appropriate configuration directives to your
CodeStream On-Prem installation.

* [Asana](asana)
* [Azure DevOps](azuredevops)
* [BitBucket](bitbucket)
* [GitHub](github)
* [GitLab](gitlab)
* [Jira](jira)
* [Trello](trello)

CodeStream also has integrations with the self-hosted GitHub Enterprise, GitLab
Self-Managed, Bitbucket Server and Jira Software services as well as the
JetBrains hosted YouTrack cloud service, but these integrations do not require
any special work from admins.

They are setup by CodeStream users and are documented in the user's guide in the
[integrations
overview](https://docs.codestream.com/userguide/features/issue-tracking-integrations/).
Self-hosted Jira Server information [can be found
here](https://docs.codestream.com/userguide/faq/jira-server-integration/).
