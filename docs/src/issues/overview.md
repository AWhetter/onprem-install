title: Issue Tracking Integrations
description: Integrate your CodeStream installation with popular issue tracking services
---

CodeStream can be integrated with a number of popular issue tracking services.
Some of them (those below) require configuration by the CodeStream server
administrator. The pages in this section will walk you through setting up each
of the services and adding the appropriate configuration directives to your
CodeStream On-Prem installation.

* [Asana](asana)
* [Azure DevOps](azuredevops)
* [BitBucket](bitbucket)
* [GitHub](github)
* [GitLab](gitlab)
* [Jira](jira)
* [Trello](trello)

CodeStream also has integrations with the self-hosted GitHub Enterprise, GitLab
Self-Managed, Bitbucket Server and Jira Server services, as well as the
JetBrains hosted YouTrack cloud service, but these integrations do not require
any special work from on-prem admins. The Jira Server integration, however, will
require involvement from a Jira admin, and additional information [can be found
here](https://docs.codestream.com/userguide/faq/jira-server-integration/).
