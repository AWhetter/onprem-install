**CodeStream On-Prem** is a docker-ized version of the CodeStream Cloud services
which you can install and operate entirely on your own hardware (or cloud
service provider). You only need a linux host OS running Docker.

If you'd like to proceed with a trial, please reach out to us at
sales@codestream.com to request access to the docker images. We'll need your
Docker Hub user ID.

## Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the components of CodeStream and how data
flows through the system.
