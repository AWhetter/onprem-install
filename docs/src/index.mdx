**CodeStream On-Prem** is a docker-ized version of the CodeStream Cloud services
which you can install and operate entirely on your own hardware (or cloud
service provider). You only need a linux host OS running Docker.

Each new installation includes a trial license to get you started.


## Quick Start

1.	Prepare a linux server or VM (referred to as the host OS) with
	[docker](https://runnable.com/docker/install-docker-on-linux). Make sure the
	unix user you login to it with is able to run docker commands _without_
	using **sudo**.

	It is important that the hostname of the host OS resolves to the same IP
	address for both itself and the CodeStream clients. Containers running on
	the host OS will talk to each other in addition to the clients.

1.	Cut and paste these commands into your shell on the host OS. They will
	download and run the control script which will install the configuration
	files, download the docker images and startup CodeStream.
	```
	mkdir ~/.codestream
	cd ~/.codestream
	curl -s -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamCodeStream/onprem-install/master/install-scripts/codestream
	chmod +x codestream
	~/.codestream/codestream --quickstart
	
	```

1.	Install the CodeStream extension in your IDE if you haven't already, and
	[set the CodeStream extension settings to reference your On-Prem CodeStream
	server (using http)](../ide/overview). For example,
	`http://your.codestream.server/`.

1.	[Register a new account and start making
	codemarks](https://docs.codestream.com/userguide/gettingStarted/create-a-team/)!

It's important to keep your On-Prem installation up to date by [simply running
these
commands](configs/single-host-linux#update-your-system-to-the-latest-version)
periodically. For more information about managing your installation, see the
[Single Linux Host](configs/single-host-linux) page.
