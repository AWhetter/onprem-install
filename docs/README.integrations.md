# 3rd Party Integrations

CodeStream supports integrations with 3rd party services, both in the cloud and
self-hosted. Individual services vary in their required configurations; some
need a public facing proxy to handle service-initiated requests. Talk to
CodeStream support to find out if this is needed for your intended
setup.


## Slack

* [Instructions for setting up Slack are here.](README.slack.md) Slack can be
  used for both authentication and as a messaging engine. Before you can update
  CodeStream's configuration you will need to create and configure a Slack App.
  Don't worry, it's easy!
